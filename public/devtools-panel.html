        <h2>What is DOMMapper?</h2>
        <p>
            The standard Chrome DevTools Elements panel, while powerful, often presents a cluttered and overwhelming
            view of the DOM, making it difficult for developers to quickly and accurately identify the CSS selectors
            needed for automation or scraping. The DOM tree is often filled with a "sea of noise"â€”hundreds of elements,
            attributes, and complex, auto-generated class names from modern web frameworks like Angular. This extraneous
            information forces developers to manually sift through layers of code, breaking the workflow and introducing
            potential errors when selecting an element.
        </p>
        <p>
            The motivation for developing DOMMapper is to streamline this process by providing a clean, focused view of
            the DOM. DOMMapper addresses this problem by cloning the existing DOM and intelligently filtering out all
            unrelated information. It removes elements that don't contain the user's specified text, and it strips away
            unnecessary attributes and framework-generated class names. This creates a simplified "map" of the DOM,
            highlighting only the relevant parent-child relationships and attributes, enabling developers to quickly and
            confidently find the stable and human-readable CSS selectors they need to interact with a page.</p>
